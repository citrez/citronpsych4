  ## Clinical Services

  
  I offer a holistic and non-judgemental approach with clients drawing upon, but not relying on, cognitive behavioural therapy. 
  I help clients of all ages to identify and change patterns of behaviour that 
  they do not find useful or promoting of their psychological well being.

      #### 1-1 consultations

      I provide 1:1 sessions of 50 minutes to adults , children and adolescents.
      Children can be accompanied by a parent and often I will see the parents together first.  Confidentiality is kept for a client of any age but I will offer  advice and consult parents in parallel with seeing a child if the child / adolescent is comfortable with this.

      I conduct psychological assessment for many purposes where psychological investigation is required.
      This includes capacity, employment, personal injury, medical negligence, asylum, immigration, human rights and criminal cases.
